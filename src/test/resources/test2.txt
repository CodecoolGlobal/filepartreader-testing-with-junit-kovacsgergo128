He looked around the cracked and broken room. The wall had split
round the door frame, and the door hung open. The window, by some
miracle was closed and unbroken. For a while he hesitated, then he
thought that if his strange and recent companion had been through
all that he had been through just to tell him what he had told him,
then there must be a good reason for it. With Marvin's help he got
the window open. Outside it, the cloud of dust aroused by the crash,
and the hulks of the other buildings with which this one was
surrounded, effectively prevented Zaphod from seeing anything of
the world outside.
